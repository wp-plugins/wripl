A sidebar widget and pop-out slider for suggesting personalised recommendations of 'what to read next' for your readers.

== Description ==

Wripl is a service which provides personalised, user controlled recommendations across the web. (Pronounced ripÂ·ple)

`[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQP4v-ZKyc]`

The wripl recommendations plugin allows you to provide a way for your blog readers to get accurate and timely recommendations on what to read next from your blog, based on the content they typically like to read.

There are currently 2 ways to deliver recommendations to your readers.

**The widget** - a simple list of text recommendations for use in sidebars.

**The slider** - a responsive, mobile friendly slider which is designed to give timely and prominent recommendations to your readers.

See wripl in action on these sites: http://wripl.com/sites

Wripl is also a hub for a user's interests, where they can manage and control their interests. Websites can then tap into wripl to provide the user with recommendations to interesting content .

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wripl-wordpress-plugin` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, and follow appropriate instructions.
1. Contact wripl directly for api tokens, and fill them out under the wripl settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I install something on my blog which requires my readers to 'connect' or 'sign up'? =

We believe it's better for your users to get recommendations which are based on their own personal interests and behaviour, in a way they can control. To achieve this we use similar technology to google/twitter/facebook (OAuth) - We really didn't want to use tracking cookies!

This allows wripl to recommend posts for each user which are specifically tailored to them and they can also use their interests across all wripl sites.

We know our plugin is not going to be for everyone, but we feel that the difference it will make to your most loyal and regular readers will be dramatic, especially in comparison with other more traditional "what to read next" plugins.

= Will wripl recommend content from other sites to my users? =

*No.* The wripl plugin is currently designed to promote your posts - the idea is help wripl users find the most relevant content for them. Your users will receive no advertisements or links which will take them away from your blog.
