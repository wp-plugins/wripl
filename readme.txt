== Description ==

Wripl is a service which provides personalised, anonymous recommendations across the web. (Pronounced ripÂ·ple)

`[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQP4v-ZKyc]`

The wripl recommendations plugin allows you to provide a way for your blog readers to get accurate and timely recommendations on what to read next from your blog, based on the content they typically like to read.

There are currently 3 ways to deliver recommendations to your readers.

**The widget** - a simple list of text recommendations for use in sidebars.

**The slider** - a responsive, mobile friendly slider which is designed to give timely and prominent recommendations to your readers.

**The 'end of content' suggestions ** - a list of recommendations at the bottom of your posts. Currently requires featured images.
